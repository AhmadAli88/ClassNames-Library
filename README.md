# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


classnames in React.js: A Deep Dive
The classnames library is a simple utility for conditionally combining CSS class names in React. It provides an elegant way to manage dynamic class names based on certain conditions (e.g., props, state, or other variables), avoiding the need to manually concatenate strings or apply complex logic directly in JSX.

Why Use classnames?
Managing dynamic class names can become cumbersome in React when you need to conditionally apply multiple classes. Without classnames, you might end up with complex conditional logic inside JSX attributes, which can reduce code clarity and maintainability. The classnames library solves this problem by providing a clean, declarative way to build className strings based on conditions.

How Does classnames Work?
The classnames library works by combining multiple class names conditionally. It can take:

String: A single class name.
Object: The keys are the class names and the values are the conditions (either true or false).
Array: An array of class names that can be conditionally combined.
